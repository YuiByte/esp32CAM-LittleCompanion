# esp32-CAM

This arduino script allows you to take pictures all 5mins and send it to telegram. The main idea of this project is to take pictures all 5mins and send it to telegram after i will use the API to download pictures sent on it.
The downloaded pictures will be analysed by a local AI that will generate a description of the photo and add the time information on it. On the same time the picture will be added autimatically to a website, after that the description will be added.

Maybe later i will add some cool features like sharing my gallery using Immich to add more detailed pictures of my life analyse them and add a description.

Functionalities ID :
- Send message on telegram when batteryâ€™s low (20%) & When it's charged (80%)
